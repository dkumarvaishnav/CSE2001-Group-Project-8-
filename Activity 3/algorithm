ALGORITHM

            1. Create a custom Vector class that wraps a std::vector and provides additional functionality.
            2. Initialize the Vector class with a vector of elements.
            3. Implement the following methods:
                  a. findSmallest: Find the smallest element in the vector using std::min_element.
                  b. searchElement: Search for a specific element in the vector using std::find.
                  c. calculateAverage: Calculate the average of the elements in the vector using std::accumulate.
                  d. display: Display the elements of the vector.
            4. In main, create an instance of the Vector class with a vector of integers.
            5. Call the methods to:
                  a. Display the vector elements.
                  b. Find the smallest element.
                  c. Search for specific elements (20 and 100).
                  d. Calculate the average of the elements.
            6. Catch and handle any runtime errors that may occur.
